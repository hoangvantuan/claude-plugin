# Overview Article Template

## Purpose

The overview article (00-overview\.md) is the single entry point for the series.
It combines introduction and key takeaways as a "trailer" that hooks readers.

## Structure

### 1. Surprising Insight (1-2 sentences)

The most surprising or counterintuitive finding from the entire series:

* Challenge assumptions

* Create immediate curiosity

* Make the reader think "I didn't know that"

### 2. Micro-Story (1 short paragraph)

A representative case, example, or scenario from the source material:

* Concrete, relatable

* Shows the topic in action

* Draws the reader into the world of the content

### 3. Core Questions (2-3 questions)

Questions the series will explore (NOT "What You'll Learn" bullet list):

* Thought-provoking, not generic

* Create genuine curiosity

* Each maps to 1-2 articles in the series

### 4. Why It Matters (1 paragraph)

* Relevance to reader

* Real-world impact

* Current importance

### 5. Key Takeaways (numbered list)

### 6. Series List (at the end)

* Same format as other articles

## Tone Guidelines

* Welcoming, not academic
